## R4. User Stories 
In the context of this application, users will be categorized into "Admin user", "Guest users" and "Members".

#### Admin user
The goal of an admin user is to update available products and quantities.

- As an admin user, its important that I can post, edit, delete and view my listings and that no one else can access those features on my product listings beyond viewing and ordering. 
<br>

- As an admin user it is important that this application offers the capabilities for me to update and adjust quantities as I replenish my stock of baked goods and to ensure that stock numbers are accurate + the ability to make changes to stock numbers where necessary. 

#### Guest users
The goal of a guest user is to view the menu of available baked goods and their corresponding prices and to locate address and contact information for Bone & Biscuit's storefront. 
<br>

- As a guest or visitor to the Bone & Biscuit web application, I'd like to have the option of navigating the site seamlessly, have an understanding of what the application does / it's purpose and experience some of the app's features such as viewing a listing. 
<br>

- The option to sign up / register is important as a guest or visitor to the application. If I enjoy my preliminary experience of the application, and it aligns with my needs I will then expect the capability of registering to the application's services to place an order. 
  
#### Members
The goal of a member in addition to the guest user goals, is to place an online order of freshly baked treats for my dog that I can conveniently collect at the Bone & Biscuit bakery location.
<br>

- Members have access to the website in its full state as per the guest user  experience  with the added ability to reserve baked goods for pickup.
